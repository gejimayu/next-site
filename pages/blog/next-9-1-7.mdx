[Next.js 9](/blog/next-9) was released six (6) months ago, followed by [Next.js 9.1](/blog/next-9-1) three (3) months ago.
These two releases added very powerful new features to Next.js, without increasing our baseline client runtime size.

Since then, we've focused heavily on refining and improving the framework as a whole:
[9.1.1](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.1),
[9.1.2](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.2),
[9.1.3](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.3),
[9.1.4](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.4),
[9.1.5](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.5),
[9.1.6](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.6),
and [9.1.7](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.7).
Let's dive into what these releases have improved!

- **[7kB – 24.7kB Smaller Client-Side JavaScript Size](#7kb--247kb-smaller-client-side-javascript-size)**: We've optimized application output even futher, shaving 7kB off hello world applications. More complex applications will show a savings up to 25kB or more.
- **[Redesigned Production Build CLI Output](#redesigned-production-build-cli-output)**: The production build output now shows gzipped file sizes in an easier to understand format.
- **[New Built-In Polyfills: Fetch API, `URL`, and `Object.assign`](#new-built-in-polyfills-fetch-api-url-and-objectassign)**: Applications can leverage the Fetch API, `URL`, and `Object.assign` in legacy browsers without compatibility concerns. These polyfills are not downloaded for 83%+ of users globally.
- **[Optimized Page Loading: x% Better Lighthouse Score](#optimized-page-loading-x-better-lighthouse-score)**: We've collaborated closely with the Google Chrome team to maximize page loading performance. This results in a much better end-user experience.
- **[Support for the Latest JavaScript Features](#support-for-the-latest-javascript-features)**: We're committed to ensuring you can always use the latest JavaScript features, including [Optional Chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining), [Nullish Coalescing](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing), and all other ES2020 (ES11) features.
- **[Zero-Config Deployment Support for `next export` Applications](#zero-config-deployment-support-for-next-export-applications)**: `next export` powered applications can now be deployed to [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/home) with zero configuration.
- **[React Strict Mode Compliance and Opt-In](#react-strict-mode-compliance-and-opt-in)**: All of Next.js' client-side runtime is now compatible with React's Strict Mode. We've also added a configuration option to enable this mode for your whole application.
- **[Automated Testing against Nightly React Builds](#automated-testing-against-nightly-react-builds)**: Next.js is automatically tested against [React's "next channel"](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/10/22/react-release-channels.html), ensuring compatibility with future releases.

All of these benefits are non-breaking and fully backwards compatible. All you need to do to update is run:

<TerminalInput
  prefix
>{`npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest`}</TerminalInput>
