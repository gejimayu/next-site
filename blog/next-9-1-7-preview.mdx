[Next.js 9](/blog/next-9) was released six (6) months ago, followed by [Next.js 9.1](/blog/next-9-1) three (3) months ago.
These two releases added very powerful new features to Next.js, without increasing our baseline client runtime size.

Since then, we've focused heavily on refining and improving the framework as a whole:
[9.1.1](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.1),
[9.1.2](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.2),
[9.1.3](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.3),
[9.1.4](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.4),
[9.1.5](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.5),
[9.1.6](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.6),
and [9.1.7](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.1.7).
